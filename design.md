# Design

The Lord of the Rings SDK is designed to provide a simple interface for accessing movie data and quotes from the Lord of the Rings API.

# Architecture


The SDK is implemented as a standalone library in Python. It consists of a single class, Movie, that provides methods for making API requests to the Lord of the Rings API.

# API Endpoints


The following API endpoints are supported by the SDK:
```
/movie: Returns a list of all movies in the trilogy.
/movie/{id}: Returns a movie object for the movie with the specified id.
/movie/{id}/quote: Returns a list of quotes for the movie with the specified id.
```

# Dependencies


The SDK depends on the requests library to handle HTTP requests.

# Testing


The SDK includes unit tests to ensure that it is functioning correctly. The tests use the unittest library to verify that the API requests are being made correctly and the data returned is in the expected format.

# Documentation


The SDK is documented using comments in the source code and a README file that explains how to install and use it. The README also includes examples of how to call the different methods provided by the SDK.

# Future Improvements


Some potential improvements for the SDK in the future could include:

Adding support for additional API endpoints.
- Implementing pagination to allow the SDK to handle large datasets.
- Adding caching to improve performance and reduce the number of API requests made.
- Adding support for other languages, such as JavaScript or Java.
